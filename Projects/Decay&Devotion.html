            in an attempt to get away from the coming zombie horde, you stop at crossroads to refuel your vehicle, or clear blockages
            you traverse the continental united states in an effort to find safe haven. You'll be defending your vehicle and thus wife

        <h2>Getting the Gang Together. .</h2>
        <p><br>
            As president of the game development club I was in charge of hosting the In development exhibition (Indev Expo)
            where I would successfully network with a developer in the industry looking to move into game development. With this
            contact I created a team along side two other students eventually inviting on a third.
