        <h1>Prelude: Getting into Games. . </h1><br>
        <p>
            My journey into game development began in high school when friends and I attempted to create a 3D platformer called EVO: 2054 using Unreal Engine. Although the project never materialized, it sparked my interest and led me to explore game development independently. I experimented with Unreal, Roblox, and eventually found my niche in Unity. After creating a parkour movement controller inspired by EVO: 2054, I realized my passion and established a development blog for my friends. Together, we decided on our first project: Astrolivid.

            -Astrolivid (The original pitch)<br>
            <br>-Game: Single player story mode and multiplayer arena and RTS sandbox
            You are given the option of several classes of ships, one is able to use its tractor beams to hurl asteroids
             towards other ships, one has railguns with a hefty charge timer but incredibly fast projectile, One is able 
             to leave behind nuclear mines, another is standard flak cannons, one with sheild projectors and slow firing 
             plasma shield stripping bolts, a carrier class holding swarms of drone fighters. Each of the ship categories
              is balanced by their armor and structural intergrity with the express goal of creating a hero shooter like
              approach to the top down real time strategy genre where fighting is a creative endeavor and not a numbers game.

        <p><br>
            Work started September 26th 2021, at the time it was believed it would only take me 1 year to complete, to clarify I had no prior experiance other than a working movement controller.
            It would take a month before the first prototype was in a playable state. The month after that I would begin learning pathfinding and make the leap to flowfield pathfinding thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr6ObNVgytk&ab_channel=TurboMakesGames">TurboMakesGames</a> 
            and finally three months in I would release my first demo 0.1.11 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/106Q8AjxqbFTCfB519wDfBcUU2X0iHvGm/view?usp=sharing">First Public Build</a>.

            It became clear after nearly 6 months of work that this project would take much longer than 1 year.
            However seeing the visuals and having a consistent vision for what the game could eventually become
            was enough motivation to know I would finish this project. It has been 863 Days or 2 Years, 4 Months, and 11 Days 
            since Astrolivid started development.
